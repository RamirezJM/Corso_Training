1. Clone the repository

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramirezjm/Corso_Training.git
   cd Corso_Training
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start watch mode to compile sass
```bash
npm run watch:css
```

4.Run the build
```bash
npm run build:css
```
--> the build process includes purgecss, which removes unused bootstrap classes, reducing the final size of styles.css by about 90%.
